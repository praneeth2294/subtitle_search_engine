One to sign for here. Oh! Well, the thing is... Sorry, I'm always doing that! Do you have the form? - And have you the pen? - Yes, of course. - Sorry, did I hurt you? - No, I had the inky end in my mouth. - Oh, right. - Sign and print, please. Next door's still up for sale. - How long's that been? - Ages. Odd, that. It's probably because we've got the plague. - Well, well. - I was joking! Just as we're talking about it, up pops the estate agent! - That IS a coincidence! - It's more than that. It's paranormal. Really? Paranormal things often happen around me. - Be lucky! - Yes, and you. - Postman Pat's been. - The girls have been at the paper. - That's marmalade! - Don't make a fuss, it's only a dab. He says paranormal things happen around him. Probably means he gets the right mail to the right house. - Probably. This is for Sandy! - Oh? - You said it was for Sandy! - I know, I know! - I think I'll go for a little walk. - Why? - I feel like it. - Why? Don't ask questions! Get the marmalade off your paper! Morning! - You weren't long. - I said a short walk. You could have walked down the hall! - Coffee? - No, thanks. Some people are looking at the house next door. Oh? Oh, I see! - The little walk. - The two events were coincidental! - They've got two children. - Monsters? I just said they had two children! What about the parents? Shifty eyes, I assume? You're not interested. When someone buys it, we'll find out what they're like. - And in the meantime... - What? All right, nothing. - Any post for me? - There. Oh! Who's the postcard from? It's for you. The message is by the name and address! You didn't read it?! It might be private! Who writes something private on a postcard? Who'd send something private to ME? - You got a Valentine card. - From you! It's from Penny and Stephen! They're in Spain! Is permanently too much to hope for? - They're popping in on the way back. - Oh good! When? Sat, they say. That's tomorrow. Bang goes tomorrow. - They'd like to stay over. - Bang goes the weekend! - Penny IS my sister-in-law. - I know. If we'd known, we could have arranged to be away for the weekend. I suppose it's too late now. Why do people write their PS so small? We've got a lovely... Bunch of coconuts? We've got a lovely surprise for you. Am I mean-spirited to feel apprehensive about that? - Yes. - Oh. Which makes two of us mean-spirited. - It isn't the end of the world. - I look forward to Friday evenings. A whole weekend to look forward to. Judy and I had planned to be out all day tomorrow. Where? - Alton Towers. - Brighton. Penny and Stephen are staying over on Saturday. - Won't it be nice? - Mum! I couldn't say no to a postcard! So we have to spring-clean our rooms? Just tidy up a bit. They can go in our room, you can go in with Sandy. Lionel and I will have your room. We need a sofa-bed. They won't make a habit of it - well, I hope not! - Sandy, there's a parcel for you. - Is there? Oh! - Aren't you going to open it? - Later. Oh! - I left the vacuum cleaner on the landing. - Did you do our rooms? They're the forbidden territories. And I didn't leave any knickers around. Just to add to the general gaiety, did Jean mention Penny's surprise? - What surprise? - I don't know. The card said they had a lovely surprise. That makes all four of us mean-spirited! DOORBELL All right! But if she has holiday snaps, I might doze off. You dare! Hola! Hello, Penny. Good holiday? Fantastico! Oh, Jean, you look drawn around the eyes. - How are you? - Rather drawn around the eyes. - How's Stephen? - Fiddling with the cases. I'll give him a hand. Come in, Penny. Penny and Stephen are here! - We should have brought a porter! - I'll get the last one. - Hello, Uncle Stephen! - Hello. - Hello, Stephen. - Hello, you two. Don't you look pretty? You always look so pretty! That's kind - perhaps you shouldn't say it in front of Aunt Penny. She doesn't mind! Penny, you don't mind me saying the girls are pretty! That man's got a death wish! That's me by the fountain in the hotel grounds. And this is me again by the same fountain ibut from a different angle.i Where's this, Stephen? - By a statue. - I can see that. Where was it? Let me think. We saw a lot of statues. Never mind. It's me by a statue. Now, this is me again in the hotel dining room - or comedor, as we say. Wait a minute! What's that waiter doing behind me? Larking about, I expect. I never did take to that man. Ahh... Oh, one of Stephen. - Where is he? - There! In the background. As you can see, he's watching me flamenco. Ole! Flamenco! Your Spanish is quite fluent, isn't it? Poco. - She picked up a Spanish chap. ALL Oh! I came to an arrangement with a taxi driver, if that's what you mean, Stephen. - That's me on some steps. - Where were they? Near a restaurant. Stephen fell down them just after he took the photograph. - Good lunch, Stephen? - It was! - Well, that's the lot. ALL Oh no! I knew there was another wallet somewhere. No, that's the lot. I was SURE there was something else. I'll send you copies of everything anyway. Oh! There they are! I knew there were some more. Actually, I think we'd better start supper. - It's five o'clock! - It's quite a tricky recipe. Just a minute. - What about the surprise? - The lovely surprise! Are you miming something? I feel tired - all that luggage and getting him through Customs. Would you mind if I had a siesta before supper? Not at all. What about the surprise? We're thinking of living in Spain. We found our dream house. Stephen, carry my bags up, please. More anon! - They're moving to Spain! BOTH GIRLS Yes! Why? Don't bother with reasons - just be happy! It starts as a warm glow just here, doesn't it? - I'll miss Stephen saying we look nice. - Yes. It's sweet. - But think what we SHAN'T miss! - That could take some time. - You two can start supper. - I only said it to escape! We should have gone out. The sooner we eat, the sooner we go to bed. That's a sensible idea. - By the way, Sandy? - Mmm? - You haven't opened your parcel! - I know what it is. A... - A what? - Or some... What are you talking about? No-one ends a sentence I know what it is. They say, I know what it is. It's a... - Or some... things. - Let's have a drink. They use two-way mirrors, you know. - What? - At the airport. Didn't you see that documentary? - They spy on you as you come through. - I'm not with you. They're spying on you. Looking for guilty expressions. Before you know it - you look guilty. - You got pulled in, then? - No. - Drink, Stephen? - Thanks very much. - Tell us about your dream house. - It was very lovely. On a hillside, overlooking a harbour. Beautiful terrace. Swimming pool. Five or six acres of land. - And it's for sale? - Oh, no. - It's never been for sale? - Not that I know. Penny said you saw your dream house. She meant A dream house. She wants to build one like it. - Build? - Well, not herself, naturally. - That could take ages! - Mmm. It's all manana there. Still, here they say at once and mean the same. - How much do dentists get paid? - Don't know. Why? I was wondering how Stephen can afford a mansion in Spain. Maybe he whips out a few extra gold fillings. He's not the type. Stephen's back on two-way mirrors. How are you two getting on? Two-way mirrors? Do we know this Stephen?! - Customs. - Any more about the dream house? It overlooks a harbour, has a pool, big terrace and seven acres of land. - It IS a mansion! - How much is that going to cost? - He's going to build one like it. - Build one? - What do dentists earn? - I asked that. They must be planning to sell up here - that's money. - Enough to buy that sort of house? - It's got to be \\u00c21,000 a tooth! They must have thought about it. - It's not our business. - No, quite. I'll try and steer the conversation round after dinner. Thank you, girls, that was a delicious dinner. Nice to get some English food again! Very acceptable - but I miss paella. I don't know why-you had diarrhoea for three days the first time! - I do wish you wouldn't use that word! - It's what it's called. What sort of dishwasher will you have in Spain? - That's a very odd question! - I'm just interested. I hadn't really thought that far ahead. But I may leave the choice to our servidora. That means servant, does it? - I didn't know you knew Spanish? - Just a little. Oh. - A servant? - I always fancied learning Hungarian. - Hungarian? Why? - I don't know really. It won't help much in Spain! But you could take it up as a hobby. - You need a hobby as you're retiring. - You're retiring? - Stephen's retiring! - Oh, good night, Stephen. - Lionel! - Sorry. Good for you. Isn't it a bit early, though? You reach a stage where you don't want to look at teeth ever again. Tooth fatigue! That's rather good! I suppose you know the Spanish for gardener? - No, I don't. - Well, we shall have one of those, too. What IS the Spanish for gardener? - Possibly two. - Two?! I wonder what the Hungarian for two is? - Oh, Stephen, nobody knows! - A Hungarian would! - Lionel, please stick to the subject! - What IS the subject? - Penny and Stephen's house in Spain! - It sounds more like an estate! I wouldn't go so far as that. Well... Perhaps a little one. And Stephen retiring! - We told you that. - Yes, I know you did. Look, I hate to be nosy but er... Judith, I suppose you know that the Spanish for fiesta is fiesta! What do you hate about being nosy? - Oh, just about everything really! - Then there's Armenian... Another language you want to learn? Just thinking how many languages there are. Will you get a pool? Essential! Well, a swimming pool and servants and gardeners... - Yes. - I see what you're getting at! - Where do you find all the money for this? JEAN iLionel!i - That's none of our business! - Sorry? Quite right, Jean! Still, I suppose there's no harm in telling. Pension plans! All down to Pen. She insisted we set them up when we got married. I've had her tasting my food ever since! JEAN Can you move over a bit? LIONEL Yes, if you want me to fall out. Look, it's no good wriggling for space because there isn't any! JEAN Truce, then. LIONEL Truce. LIONEL You've no sense of honour! JEAN It's only for one night! That's carved in stone. You were very quiet this evening. - I was thinking about pension plans. - Why? Because I haven't got any. I have. - No need to be smug! - I'm not, I'm just stating a fact! - How long have you had pension plans? - Years. - I haven't. - You just said that. I never thought of it before. Don't worry. What's mine is yours. - We'll be all right. - Hmmm. What happens when I go mad? JEAN Are you planning to go mad? Of course not, but it does happen. Lionel, how many mad people do you actually know? Well... Not mad. Funny. They're not cheap, you know, those homes. Oh, you're going into a home now? I'd have to! No knowing what I'd get up to here. - This isn't very cheerful, is it? - No. If you DID keep me here, you couldn't invite anyone to the house. Oh, stop it! Just a few royalties from the book. Capital from the flat - that's all I've got. I never thought the day would come when Penny was cleverer than me. Have the girls got pensions? - They're children! - They're not. It rushes up on you, time. Which of us pushes the supermarket trolley? - At least you'll be all right. - I told you - we'll BOTH be all right. Provided I don't go funny. They're not cheap, those homes, you know. Tell you what. I'll keep you in a kennel in the cellar. How's that? - You're not taking it seriously! - Am I meant to? - Mention pensions and you're going mad! - Well. - That might be excessive. - Really. I just wonder what I'm contributing to our future, though. You. Now go to sleep. I'll try. One more thing, Lionel. If you go mad in the night, do it quietly. Penny can get hysterical. - Not leaving Stephen behind, are you? - I'm going for a walk - a paseo. DOORBELL I'll get that. Hey, hey-Penny! - Buenos dias. - Salut! - That's not Spanish. - What was yours? - Spanish! - Buena fortuna. - May I come in? - Of course. - Hi, Li. - Hi, Alistair. - Is the delicious Sandy in? - Yes. - Don't you mean Judith? - No. Sandy. - Can we have a quick word? - Any time, Li! Is it anything I should know about? No. - So - shoot! - Alistair, I'd like your advice. - I'm honoured! What's the prob? - I need some money. - How much? - I need to make some money. - Oh, I see. Right. - You didn't say that with any confidence. The book, iMy Life In Kenya,i isn't setting the world on fire. I know. Last quarter's royalties were \\u00c232.45. I meant the lecture circuit. What are the chances of getting back on? - Well, er... Let's see. - None. - Did I say that? - No, but your face did. Don't give up on this, Li. Can you sing? No, I can't sing! What are you talking about? It's just an idea. A CD. iThe Songs Of Kenyai by Lionel Hardcastle. - Bit wild, eh? - Just slightly, yes. - Another book! i- My Life In Holland Parki? Perhaps not. - I shouldn't have lumbered you with this. - Never say die, Li. I might come up with something. But why the sudden need for bucks? - I haven't got a pension plan. - Oh. Don't take this the wrong way- isn't it a bit late to start one? - Jean's had one for years. - Great! Money in the kitty! - Yes, but... - No buts, Li! She loves you! It's her right to share! Just as if I'm with a lady who insists on taking her clothes off it's her right to do it! - It's not really the same thing, is it? - No, I suppose not. My God, that was ambrosia. - It was just a fry-up! - Yes, but after Spanish breakfasts... I don't think a man feels a man until he's got bacon inside, do you? I'll have to think about that. Looks like rain. Perfect! Nothing like English rain. Is there, Lionel? - Is there what? - Anything like English rain. Our last lot came over from France. Yes, but when it got here it was proper English rain. We're off. Will you still be here later? Pen and I thought we'd treat everyone to a pub lunch. That's nice! See you later. Then there's Hampshire rain... The Spanish don't play cricket. Temperamentally unsuited, I suppose. Maybe they think it's a silly game. No-one could think that. Clunk! - Clunk?! - The sound of willow on leather. Wasn't very good, though, was it? Do you think boink might be nearer? - No, I think clunk was quite good. - Really? Nothing like village cricket. Pen and I often go on a Sunday. Only time I get to wear my Panama. - I didn't know Penny liked cricket. - Oh, she generally nods off. It's pleasant, though. Sunshine... the grass that very particular English green, cup of tea and a scone. Clunk, of course. Nothing like it. God, it's good to be home! What? For someone moving to Spain, you're rhapsodising about England. - I'm not going to live in Spain. - What? - Have you told Penny? - No. - Don't you think you should? - No. When will you tell her? As she's packing? She'll come to the same conclusion as me. - You're confident. - I know my Pen. She gets an idea and before you know it, it's gone. Like the ouija board. - Ouija board? - She decided to investigate the occult. Two goes we had. The nearest we got to a message was Black Nixto. - That was that. Always the same. - You're quite right! - But you still won't tell her? - It's kinder not to. We couldn't make it work. We couldn't afford that kind of place. This pension business is all very nice but not seven acres and servants. Well, I'm glad you're not going, Stephen. Thank you. Me, too. It wouldn't be the same without you and Penny around. We'll be around a lot more now I'm retiring! - Come on, Pen! We're going to lunch. - Don't bellow when I'm on the loo! - I don't do it often. - Where's my bag? There you go. Incidentally, I noticed the house next door is up for sale again! - I'm sure it'll go fast. - Like hot cakes! It makes you think. A house like that in London, next to our dearest friends... And we could afford it now! Thank you again for putting us up. You and Lionel in a single bed! We were as snug as two bugs in a rug, weren't we? Very cosy. - Were you two all right? - We were fine. A bit squashed but we were fine. - Squashed... - Keep him walking, he's glazing over! - Why are you pulling me? - Do you think they'd buy that house? Let's hope it's another ouija board. - What now? - Look! There IS a God. - Come on, we're getting left behind. - Wait. Morning! Morning! What nice people! Aren't they nice people?

Look what we have here. - Are you from the police? - Take it easy. I want to see identification. Has the office sent you? Come here. Do as we say and there won't be any trouble. The question is if this is the calm before the storm or the start of something new. Good morning, Inspector. Can I take the paper? Are you okay with Ola? Where's the paper? Bill took it. - Has he started sleeping over? - I must go. The signs from the print shop were all wrong. - Will you give Orjan a key? - Do we want him here? He said the attic look like hell. Neither I nor the surveyor saw anything wrong. Take it up with Orjan. He's here now. I thought I'd invite Bill to dinner. Nina will probably be pleased. I'm ready. It wasn't that bad. If you hadn't been so stubborn, you wouldn't have been hurt. Let's get some air. We've earned it. Arthur, concentrate on the house over on the right. - Which house? - Over there on the right. God damn it, you son of a bitch! Shout louder so everyone can hear and see you. Put those drawings back. I didn't think we were going to kill him. What should we do then? You don't think he would call the police? An old security man. Grow up, kid. Look, he locked the door from the inside, after he jumped. Talented guy. - I know it's my week... - Listen to me! Tuesday we have training. You were on driver training just recently. Should I say,I can't train for night- shooting because my girls need a drive? But, my God... What's important, Sophie? Fuck you. Are you even working on Tuesday? Hello! Let me look at you. What clothes! Real smooth. Nobody wants to do business with a loser. That's true. But clothes aren't everything, even if they say it. - Is everything arranged? - Yes. Neat. You need to set some priorities. I have my own list. Buy some Chinese food and I'll see you at home. - We're supposed to... - We'll talk at home. Good to see you. I wasn't expecting applause, but you look completely squashed. - What is it? - Sometimes you have to work with idiots. All right. Thank you. We'll joke with my brother. Drive like hell. What the hell...! Drive, damn it! Automatics. White VW FSO 067 M\\u00e4rsta Rentals I'll call you back. Both Vans are yours. The weapons are in the trunk of the burgundy one. Here, take them. We'll come back at midnight, so we don't lose the weapons. Be on time. Good job. Maybe your brother is to be commended. He's talented, but he works for me. I control everything. That may be worth remembering. Will old Kalashnikovs be enough? Otherwise, I have a nice AK5 and AK5C, with or without mortar. You mean a grenade launcher located underneath? - Yes. - I'll be damned. Kalashnikovs are good. They'll still do the job. - When do I get the cash? - Two days, as we said. Good. Hey. The white VW was rented with fake ID. The rental company is emailing surveillance video as soon as they can. Must be a record! The bastard was out two minutes... before he ended up in a stolen car. Let me have the photo of the person who rented the car. Service Tunnel Fr\\u00f6lunda Square Shopping Centre The one worked there before was prettier than the one who came later. Off! Turn it off! - Hell! - Put your hands up! Now! Stop! Stay calm! Do not move. Show me your hands. - Both hands! Now! - Fire in the hole! Don't move! Don't move! 85 seconds. Good. And when the hell do you use it? - Okay. Was anyone injured? - No. Ouch... Ouch, ouch! All right. - Do we know how many there were? - We'll check. Robbery in Fr\\u00f6lunda Square. Major Crimes is involved. Hey! It's me, the cute one. Well if you call back... Patrick, check this! The latest Intel from the robbery at Fr\\u00f6lunda Square. According to the guards, the robbers filmed everything... including the damage from explosives. - Why film their own robbery? - Quality assurance for next time. Next time? I know that look, Johan. Let the Major Crimes Division handle this. Hey. Should we remove the barricades? - Ask Forensics. Why haven't you called me? Bad luck! Two traffic tickets. And still, you park in the middle of a precinct. - Why haven't I called? - Yes. You planted my DNA in a ski mask. So that I'd be so shit-scared I'd come crawling to you. One can see from the deposits in that hair... that it was only a few weeks old. I've checked it. And the robbery you tried to frame me for, was committed... when was that? 1997? That's 14 years ago. Oops. Was that so hard now? Consider what happens to cops who end up in jail for entrapment. Can you handle that? Don't worry about me. I don't snitch. I never snitch. Not even on a cop. Can I give you a tip? With the best of intentions. You should chill out a bit. You seem so damned uptight. I don't know why... I'll just help you. So. Beautiful woman! It's much softer released. The other way is so severe. That's cute. \\u00c5hstr\\u00f6m! Good. Should we move that stuff now? There you are! Fr\\u00f6lunda Square. The guards said they could neither receive or call out. I was there. Perfect reception. Lunch! Matte checked mobile calls made at the time. There were none. None at all. They must have used a jamming device. Explain where to find the link to organized crime. Give info to Major Crimes. The vegetarian is Sophie. What a place. It would be great to live here. You could enjoy yourself like a prince in a baker's shop. You can have the new weapons on Monday. When would you like to have the truck and the van? As soon as possible, no later than five days. Then we'll settle up. 160 for the previous job. 40 in advance for the last one. Last? You mean the next. We're not going to stop now? It will be the last one. I promise you. We'll take the AK5s. They're more reliable. Should we shoot them next time? We'll see. Cheers! Can I come down now? Why don't you trust me? Does it feel like I don't trust you? Yes. Okay. I'll give you more to do. All right. You should hang out more with the gang. Otherwise, they'll lose respect for you. Who's losing respect? Never mind. Just be aware of it. Who? Is it Victor? Conny? Or Alm, talking shit in jail? Who's losing respect? And Frank? Did you get a hold of him? Is it so hard to call Frank Wagner? He doesn't answer. I only get a foreign dial tone. Oh well, that sounds brilliant. It worked out well, taping the camera to the gun. - Hey. - Hey. Thank's for that. It went well. Funding for Phase 2, and good info. - A progress report? The next batch of vehicles in five days. - Elomaa? - The plates come in tomorrow, from Poland. And Larsson? The AK-47s have been destroyed. I'm getting new ones. - Will they be AK5s? - Yes. - How did you do it? - A good contact. Good. I'll check that they work. Good. Elomaa and Svensson, take us through the details of the home visit. We compared the old man info with the armoured truck film. It seems correct. It's the same manufacturer. Mind you don't scratch his nice car. International business law. It sounds exciting. It's pretty dull, but it'll be more fun when I start working. Nice car you have. Expensive? Dad always said there are two kinds of people. What then? Those who get things to be someone else... and those who do it to be themselves. The old man always saw things in black and white. I don't remember much of him. Hello, in the middle of dinner? Done for the day. Nina, we'll see you next weekend. Absolutely. - Orjan is Nina's father. - We met at the birthday party. I'll call and let you know what I found. Tell us now. Do you want something? - No, I have to go. The power lines are lying on top the insulation in the attic. Yes, on top. Condensation in the sheathing can catch fire anywhere. We'll pull out all the lines and reposition them under the insulation. I'll bring an electrician tomorrow. Can you get me a couple of signs to...? - I have some other colleagues who... - Absolutely. Good. Then we're even. - Bon appetite. - Hey! Not strictly legal, right? Exchanging services between companies in private. Well, I don't know... - Good morning, Matte. - Good morning. Will you check out a guy for me? I think he's a felon. Here's the plate number on his car. - WILD-23? - Yes. What is it? If this isn't enough, we'll put it aside. Three jammers have been stolen from National Defence in the past four years. One in Afghanistan one in Kosovo and one... - In Gothenburg? - Probably a former officer. G\\u00f6ran Svensson, born in '77. The clown got two years for grand larceny in 2009. He had a Land Rover with jamming antennas parked in his garage. Now it gets really interesting. The jamming transmitter was never found. A stolen Land Rover in his garage? What a fucking airhead. I compared Svensson's registered cell phone... with other prepaid numbers used at the same cell tower lately. It gave an unregistered prepaid number he probably uses. If we compare the numbers of other prepaid phones he called... we find a common denominator among the subscriptions. All the phones are turned off a few times a week north of town. They shut down both their official and their prepaid phones. Then we have the identity of the others. They're all professional officers or former officers. - All served together abroad. - Afghanistan. - Elite Soldiers? - Usually officers. All on long-term sick leave for PTSD. You want to see organized crime. Where did G\\u00f6ran Svensson serve his sentence? Who was he best friends with? How the hell would I know? Seth Rydell. Sophie. The picture was in my email this morning. From a car rental firm in Stockholm. - It was G\\u00f6r... G\\u00f6ran... - Svensson. ...Who rented the car with fake ID and picked up Seth Rydell from prison. Is it enough for the boss? If we take this over from Major Crimes, it had better not go wrong. Attach a tracker to Seth's car, but wait with the military. We already put a tracker there. Last week. Sophie wanted to. He turned off towards G\\u00e4rdsl\\u00f6sa. He turned off towards G\\u00e4rdsl\\u00f6sa. Thank you. Niklas, you're a psychologist. How can you tell if someone is a psychopath? A true psychopath? You can't. You can't. Does that apply to all psychopaths? No, but if you mean a real psycho... He turned off towards G\\u00e4rdsl\\u00f6sa. If we're talking about the universal, populist definition... everyone's a psychopath. - There! Want to look? - No. I trust you. Hold it, listen up... Come, Viktor. How's it going? Good. I've been away for a while. Almost three years. It's a long time. It's easy to forget who's pulling the strings. Don't. That would be the wrong attitude to have. Right? - Right? - Sure. Good. Now they're leaving. They're taking Gjutj\\u00e4rnsgatan east. He's heading for Backaplan. He's met two people, and dropped off a large heavy bag. It's been put in the back seat of a Pontiac Firebird. Got it. Anyone you know? One is Svensson, the other is probably Larsson. Larsson's plate number is Tore, Urban, Bertil, 136. That's correct. Okay, Niklas, go to Larsson's home. Here they come. Larsson and Svensson. Svensson's going east. Larsson's walking to his door. He has the bag with him. A dark gray sports bag... - with two beige, vertical stripes. - Got it. When he leaves home as usual, we'll do one of our special jobs. - The subject is leaving without the bag. - 11. Understood. 11 and 10 are going in. Vidar, stay with the subject. - Niklas, stay away from the residence. He's parked at the turnaround on Krokilv\\u00e4gen. Got it. Well, I'll be damned. He's disappeared into the woods on a small bicycle. Creative bunch. I'll relieve you in an hour. It looks like he turned off his phones. - 01to 90. Your 80? -01, 90 is at Polstj\\u00e4rnegatan. Go up to Tunnbindaregatan 6 Water leak. Superintendent requests assistance to go into the apartment. That was pretty quick. I closed the valve, but the water is still running. Police. We need to look around in here. - I was sitting on my couch... - Do you want to come in and look? I was sitting in my apartment, and the water was running down the walls. - Damn. - Contact the insurance company. The cuckoo is on the way back now. - Got it. We're ready here. - Yes. - A really tough place to live. - Yes. Here you go. - Have you had time to check everything? - No, not yet. - Check this out! - What? - Holy shit. - Well, I'll be... Police! What are you smoking? I can't borrow from the company's tax account. - Why so much? - Take a look at this place. The bank is howling about a compulsory sale order. I have half but I need another 90 grand. - Take a payday loan, like you usually do. - I can't take a payday loan. - You can only get up to 3000. I'm joking. Oh, funny! Hey. Hey. - Tough job without Frank? - Don't mention that pig. He pulled in the dough. And he was nice. See you on Sunday, baby. One night and one more night. Bye, Mamma. See you later. You can borrow 50,000 and take Luna every second week. For the whole week. Then I can work more. The rest you can borrow from your friends. I can't babysit every second week. How's the truck and the van? - Everything is ready. And the pallet lifter? - Everything's ready, I said. - Good, good! The accused officer refuses to speak at the hearing. Of all the houses around, only Larsson's place flooded, and his flat was below it. He didn't count on the bad luck of someone doing a search. Bad luck or not, I don't like that kind of coincidence. Their prepaid phones from last night. Between 5 and 7 pm. Then their official phones were turned off. They moved around constantly, but stayed for 18 minutes here, at Lundbyleden. Another armoured truck hold-up in the tunnel? Yes. Or a diversion. Shutting down one of the tunnels will create chaos. Then they continued up to here, where all the phones were turned off. We'll watch that area tonight. There are only 12 houses, so it's pretty quiet. We'll have helicopter support, and our honorable chief will co-ordinate. According Matte all phones in the area have been turned off. 10 understood. Object Adam is cycling towards Erik 5. Got it. The heat activity between houses Erik 5 and Filip 6. - Got it. - We're returning to S\\u00e4ve to refuel. I'll get closer. Vidar, this way. Damn. The house at Erik 5... A light upstairs and black cardboard on the windows. - Got it. Move closer. - Got it. We need a replacement for Larsson. It has to be someone we can trust. If we had someone like that, they'd be here already. The people I trust are in this room. What is it? I have an idea. I'm not really sure. For half a billion it's worth the risk. Yeah, I know... - It feels unprofessional. - Keep it to yourself.. You won't believe this. Half a billion? You must have heard wrong. Only the Riksbank has... ...that much money. I'll call you later. Riksbank? That's like a fortress. Yes. The only weak link their transport. I'll inform county police, will you contact Riksbank. I'm glad the prison guards had such respect for you. It was practical. You get help where you can find it. One other thing... Are you looking for a job? What kind of job? That last thing you talked about? Can you weld and drive a truck? Well, welding... I took the truck driver's course 15 years ago. But I haven't driven since. Good enough? It's only as a spare driver. We need people to carry. I've already suggested you. - For what? - A robbery. A big fucking robbery. - I need to know more. - No, you can't. Not until I know you're with us. - We need four AK5s. - I can arrange that. One of them is expensive. It's the one with a grenade launcher. A grenade add-on. That's cool. Is it a big job? - Eight people? - No, four, with you. Do they know who I am, what my name is? - No, no. - Good. Let's keep it that way. I don't trust you to keep your mouths shut if you're caught. That's why. That's the deal if I join you. Want a beer? You get 20, if you're in. Twenty? I don't get out of bed for that! - What's so funny? - 20 Million. - What? - 20 Million. Is that enough to get out of bed? It could be. Bank of Sweden, Southern Region Thanks for meeting with us so quickly. Unfortunately, I'm on my way to Stockholm. Sorry? Our retired Chief Engineer Arthur J\\u00f6nsson will be buried tomorrow. - Sad. - Yes. What's on your mind? We have information that someone plans to rob one of your shipments. Yes. As security chief, you may want to know, so you can do something about it. Yes, but you must have more than that? When, where, how, what? Maybe? The fact is, we don't. The guy who was inside with Svensson, what was his name? - What? - Only Svensson knows his name. If he's as ruthless as Svensson says, maybe he'll take the money afterwards. Svensson describes him as a gangster. Maybe it's okay if I... ...take care of him afterwards. Since when did you ask permission? It's good to have a guy like that. We don't even know how to steal a car. No. We're not good thieves! We get a couple of tips a month, but so far nothing has happened. We are quite confident the information is correct. - And I'm trying to be very diplomatic. - Yes, but you must understand me too. We need more than this to change our routines. I can tell you that the truck in which the banknotes are transported... makes Barack Obama's limousine look like a soapbox. 173412. Any attempted hijacking will trigger the destruction of the banknotes. Can you give us a hint how much you carry? Never more than three billion. Twelve pallets. Three billion? If you manage to get into the cargo area... Each pallet... has a GPS transmitter. You have to find every GPS transmitter... among all those cubic meters of banknotes. I think you can sleep well. Why makes you think we sleep well? Three escort cars. The escort chief sits in the one... directly behind the money. He's a pro. -17.35.22. - Got it. A two kilometer tunnel gives 92.7 kmh Good. That bastard is no Chris Amir. But I don't know what snitches you've had. It may work out anyway, right? He's a monster, Sophie, with a gang of obedient fools under him. You know he's killed people. Even his own. So tell me, do you have full control of what your infiltrators do all the time? - Huh? - I don't understand. Oh, come on. Frank is dangerous. Everyone knows that. If it were possible to control informants, what are we doing here? Sophie, Frank shot into Tommy's armoured vest, he didn't kill him. It was the other guy who shot him. Frank shot at the vest intentionally. So he's not a cop killer. Are you absolutely sure? Trust me. Frank plays the psychopath, Seth is a psychopath. A fucking difference. Respects, dear friend. But you're right. We should try. - Put the cover on and tighten the screws. - Thanks, Dad. She'll be alone with that psycho. If anyone can do it, it's Sophie. - Yes, but... - What? What's the problem? Hey! - What is it? - Okay, let's do it. Well, little Miss DNA. Which words didn't you understand last time? - What if Felix had opened the door? - 1. He's at the bar. 2. You cleaned up since yesterday, when G\\u00f6ran Svensson was here. 3. You turned off the radio on the way to the door. - Turned off the radio? - Yes. Walther 9 millimeters. Some careless buddies must have forgotten it. - Nice place you have here. - Yes. Now you've seen it, fuck off. You won't get away from me that easily. Perhaps it's you who won't get away. If you don't start working for me I'll lock you up for three to five years. Plus the conditional part of your previous sentence. - You're both beautiful and stupid. - Shut up and listen! The armoured truck robbery at Fr\\u00f6lunda Square. What you're planning for the Riksbank shipment. You got the AK5s we found at Fredrik Larsson's. We know you're mixed up with the robbery. Your little brother is involved so we'll take him too. What kind of Riksbank shipment? I don't understand. You have 20 seconds to give us some answers. Flash your headlights three times. That guy out there will be your backup handler. Only we will know your identity. Give it up! I cannot and will not be your snitch. It's not going to happen. Your 20 seconds is up now. - Do I have a choice? - Not anymore. - I have to take it. - Go ahead. Yes. No, you're not interrupting. I said I'd take Luna next week. Yes. What do you doubt? Natascha, I don't have time for this. Not now. Fuck what I do. Keep your end of the deal. I'll keep mine. I've said so. There is just one number in this. You can only call that number. Charger. Always have it on. I'll call tomorrow afternoon, so we'll see. Oh, right... I'll give you this, Seth. It looks much better unbound. How did you know he was involved in the robbery? I took a chance. Seat belt. - You've been with GSI three years, right? - Two years and eight months. - How long were you undercover? - 865 Days. Before that National Police, overseas service for three years in Afghanistan. - Before the Police Academy, psychology and law school. I'm just a regular a cop from Skovde, have been since I was 20. What about Johan? He's cute. But not my type. I know you want to sleep with him. You said yourself that he freaked out in Germany when it heated up. So... Do you trust him? There's Svensson. Goggles. Don't see those every day! - Is it stolen? - Yes. These are from my contact. Our new member. A CSR with grenade launcher. Don't see those every day either. - Okay, a function check. - I have to try it. - I saw movement in the window. - The toilets are probably down there. Shall we take a walk? That sounds good. - Fine dining. - Magical. Smoke? - What's going on? - An infra-red light in the woods. - Police? - No idea. We can't take any chances. We'll switch to the alternate plan. Okay. The subjects are leaving the house, heading for the road. The back! Sit in the back seat. Is this inconvenient? When it's time to move, we'll fake a drug bust and grab you. The holdup cannot go ahead. We'll arrest the others for intent. The evidence against you won't be enough. So you'll skate and become a hero to your guys. Then you'll be compensated by the State for two weeks in jail. It sounds a little too simple. How do we avoid suspicion for example from Svensson? A car chase. You try to escape from us we force you into a ditch... and you get a good beating. Oh, great. - Are you serious? - Consider it a perk. For us. We're meeting tomorrow for a rehearsal. Okay. Thanks. Where and when is the holdup? If you know so much, why don't you grab them all now? And let them avoid a long prison sentence? Are you naive, Seth? The plans have changed and you can't be involved. I've killed for your sake. - Doesn't that mean anything? - Yes, very kind. You can help me with something important to the job. You can help me with Luna. - Help you with Luna? - Yes. I can't tell Natascha our arrangement has gone to shit in the first week. It's just a couple of hours tonight. A couple of hours, please, Felix. Hey? I looked up the guy with WILD 23. Okay. No trace of a criminal record... But I googled him. I found a photo from a classic car club. He's had cars since he was a kid and fixed them. He's a nerd. But that's not illegal. - Are you keeping an eye on him? - Johan! - We're moving. - Thanks. Through Sophie, we know the robbers are rehearsing this afternoon. Johan and Sophie will take the Lundby tunnel... the rest will follow Lundstr\\u00f6m to try and figure out the escape route. - Lundstr\\u00f6m's leaving the house. - Got it. He's getting into a red Volvo 440. Plate number Adam, Tage, Sigurd 129. I'd bet my new article in Modern Psychology... that's Elomaa sitting next to him. Got it. Cute. Did you bring hot dogs, too? This is where the phones were detected for 18 minutes. They were also at the other entrance... but only for a short time. Have you heard anything from... Hj\\u00f6rdis? No, but he promised to call when they're ready. The glass is broken. We can not... Are you ready? The car's over here. Do you want something to eat? The monkey is smarter than the lady Niklas, I'll drive between you and the Volvo. They're heading for G\\u00f6ta tunnel. Is that something new? They took route 155 before to Lundby tunnel. I'll turn off and rejoin them on the other side. Johan and Sophie have nothing to report from Lundby tunnel. There are no parking spots on the east side of the tunnel... except at the service station... and that's exposed. They may have been there when they were spotted earlier. We parked 400 meters away on a forest road. 01, this is 13. The Volvo has been abandoned in G\\u00f6ta tunnel. Got it. - Did you see anyone nearby? - No but here are several exits. God damn it! This is our day labourer. We'll call him Stefan. - What should I call you? - You can call me Chief. Hey, boss. They've left nothing to chance. They stopped at an emergency exit into the other tunnel. Damn... It feels so weird having Hj\\u00f6rdis there. Hj\\u00f6rdis? After my grandmother. Niklas and Vidar, we are moving towards the west end of Lundby tunnel. Sophie and Johan remain at the east end. -13 Understood. - Hey... what I said about Tommy and Frank... - Forget it. You weren't to know. - Want some? - No thanks. Where did you do military service? KA3. As a radio operator. - A real warrior. - Do we have a problem? - Don't you have anything better? It's lively. - We're leaving in ten minutes. - Yes. Why are we taking all this stuff if we're just practising? You don't get it, do you? Turn it down. - The brakes feel spongy. - Now you're just bitching. You whine constantly. Did your wife cut you off for a year? What if I bitch because she didn't cut me off? The brakes feel weird. Lill-Gnistan has checked their red Volvo, and it is completely empty. Not even a candy wrapper on the floor. Thanks, Matte. 01, 12 and 13 in position at the west entrance. No sign of the subjects yet. We'll pull-in at a parking space. Hey, check it out. If it's them, they're damned meticulous. It's a full-scale exercise. Or it could be a truck driver taking a piss. Let's go! Two welds on every emergency exit. We'll do both sides. We'll do both side, just in case. - The left tunnel entrance. - What are they doing? It's not Seth. Subjects seen inside the east entrance. They have a truck. Two of them, wearing yellow road crew jackets. It doesn't add up. Seth... I mean Hj\\u00f6rdis, told us too much for the robbery to be happening now. If he's participating, it must be a rehearsal. Put yourself in his place, For this many millions, I'll betray the lady. What would you say if you wanted it, but the cops were watching you? - Johan, is it time to strike? - Seth knows what he's gotten into. Maybe he's just as suprised as us. They haven't told him everything. Sophie, I can't contact Johan. Are we going in? I don't believe the robbery is happening now. - 01 To 10, come in. - Okay. 11 To all, we'll wait. - Got it. - Why aren't we going in? The brakes don't feel good. Tell the escort leader... that he should stay well back from us or farther out in front. Oskar 1, Oskar 4 Listening. The brakes are bad. The escort car should stay farther ahead or behind us. Okay, we'll remain behind you, so be careful going down the slope. - Did you see that behind the tree? - Where? On the slope by the service station. It looks like Elomaa. Where's he going? Elomaa is above the tunnel. He's disappeared into the trees. Here comes the Riksbank transport. Entering the tunnel now... escorted by three black Volvos. Didn't they just clean here last week? What the hell... Stop! Is he turning into the tunnel? Look at the case. God damn, it's going down! Hell, no signal. That's a cell phone tower. Take cover! Get the civilians out! - Do you have cover? - No! Get back! What the hell...? - Get back! - Get them out of here! Take cover! Get back! It worked. He's my brother. He's with us! Without him it wouldn't have worked. - Your partner? - He's knocked out. I've disabled the inking system and explosives according to plan. Head to the emergency exit! It's locked! It's locked! Fuck! Back! Fire in the hole! Back in the tunnel! Get back! Get back! Two minutes. - There's reception here. - Emergency. Robbery in progess in Lundby tunnel. - The Riksbank transport. - Riksbank transport? - Yes! Send everything you have. - Let's get moving. 01 to 10. What's the situation, please. A White van drove into the east tunnel entrance. No traffic coming out. Cell tower blown up, plus probable jamming of police frequencies. We've warned traffic away from the scene. We must drive against the traffic flow. Got it. The robbery is close to your end. We can't get through. The traffic is backed up here. It must be stalled in the tunnel. Three minutes. Yes, come on! The lead in the sheets will neutralize the GPS transmitters, so put them on. Throw on the sheets. Let's go! Grab this. Next sheet! Damn. The nearest road? Right here, left, then right again. - Did you say left? - Yes. Goddamn stupid old bastard! Stand still! Show your hands! - Don't move! - Shoot him, you fucking fool! Goddamn... I'm hit. - G\\u00f6ran, G\\u00f6ran, it's me. Come on! It went through the vest. What are you doing? Take the gun and leave him. Let's go. It went through the vest. - Damn. - Hurry up! 10 and 11 arriving at the service station. No response. There's no reception here. - Damn! - That case is the jammer. The stairs! Police! What if he was in on it. Huh? What if he's deceived us the whole time? I'll kill the fucking bastard. You've really dropped me in the shit. - You waited too long to strike. - It was my decision. - Are you blind? - I see everything you see. And? - We do our job. Do you have confidence in them? - How long are we staying here? - 'Til things calm down. A few days. We have clean clothes, a well-stocked fridge. Cold beer. The escape truck was found at the harbor. They're probably in the archipelago, north or south. The Coast Guard estimates... with all their boats, and with helicopters, their's and our's... it would takes two months to scour all the islands. Even longer to search on foot. This must be the first time robbers have taken billions and got away with it. Get those bastards. I don't care how... nor does the police chief. Just do it. Thank you for coming. We'll update you on the latest... If we don't solve this we'll be hung in the town square. I'm not kidding. Has anyone been through this before? An infiltrator we can not trust. - An informer. - Call it what you will. Now he's in there, undercover. Or he has his own agenda. Or both. We need to fucking fix this. What is it? - Huh? - What is it? - What's with you? - What's with me? Quit, if you don't trust the bosses. You can quit. This isn't the military, it's the police No, I won't quit. Someone else might want to do it. Listen all of you! We have received a report from the forensic technicians. Analysis shows 7 of the bullets which hit the security guard... came from a 2.23-calibre rifle. A 556 or an AK5. And three came from a 9-millimeter Walther. - Walther? - Yes. It's German. I know what that is. The rifling from the barrel identified it. Almost everyone else is working on this case, so let's do this. Dig up all the robbers, their mothers, fathers, girlfriends, sisters... Find something that links someone to the archipelago. Let's go back three years. If necessary, go back to the last century. Or the archaeology records. The limit is the rock carvings at Tanumshede. Is that mine? - Yes. - We only got one pallet. - A deal is a deal. Twenty million, in used notes. - And the poor guy up there? - Shush... He'll be fine. He's been asking for you... Stefan. How will I take everything with me when you let me off? And how will you manage the rest? We have a boat on another island. A 24-metre Wally. It'll take us where we're going. - I'll go up and see him. - Gunshot wounds and alcohol don't mix. It thins the blood. Sad. How's everything? The morphine helps. The boss is good at nursing, but worse at lying. This kind of gunshot wound won't heal itself. I need surgery. Otherwise... If you end up in hospital, they'll uncover everything... and set the wheels in motion. Better to go to prison... than to die. Do you know what feels worse? It's my mother. Explaining to neighbours and friends. My boy robbed the Riksbank, but he's really very nice. Your mother's right. You're kind. A little too kind. - Stefan, we need to talk. - About what? Svensson. We'll leave him on the island. He'll die if we take him. So, he ends up in hospital and gets 20 years in prison. Serves his time. The money is waiting for him. Everything is hunky-dory. But if he doesn't keep his mouth shut? It doesn't matter. Where we're going there's no extradition treaty. If you have money. I'm talking about me, staying in this country. Svensson never said who you are. That was the deal. - I don't think he'll say anything. - You don't think... - We thought we'd have a barbecue. - And reveal our position with smoke signals. There are thousands of islands here. With a hundred barbecues per island.. No one will think we'd dare barbeque. Then we'll leave tomorrow. My mother was an amateur psychologist and Dad some analytical ADHD fanatic. Funny. And your story? As I said, I had over-protective parents. I wanted something dangerous, so I joined the military. Now I'm just a regular guy who's bitter after 28 years of service to the state. See here. It was a deep wound. I couldn't use the arm for three months. You know what I got as compensation? Five grand. 5,000. The state is a fucking pimp. Well isn't this nice. New friends? Are you learning robber language for babies? Morse code for idiot. Go ahead and laugh. You have a lot to laugh about. You disarmed your partner so well,. Svensson is laughing himself to death. It's not a good idea to have Elomaa as an enemy. Wouldn't you say? - Do we have anything other than beer? - Take it easy. Maybe I'll buy a boat. I think it's affordable now. - You can buy the whole \\u00c5land Ferry. - Perfect. Lots of duty free. There's no longer any duty free. They tax us to death. Then I might buy one of these. Coast Guard Rescue, you are calling on channel 16. I'm going to get one of these boats! Why are you shouting? - Damn, what is it with you? - What are you doing? Are you spying on me? - You're always staring at me. - I'm keeping an eye on you. I don't trust you. What have you got there? Why don't you relax. We're in the same boat. - Show me what's in your hand. - I have nothing. If you don't trust me, we have a problem. Now stop playing clever with me. Okay? Now I'll release you. Stay still. - Are you drunk? - No. Where's Elomaa? We're playing poker. He was at the pier. He was going for a swim or something. I think I'll take a couple of million from my share. You can take care of the rest for me. Okay? - If you trust us. - It's not about trust. You wouldn't dare cheat me. - Do you have a smaller bag? - What happened? How small? Will this do? Yes, I'll take it. Aren't we playing poker? Listen. Cut it out, now. Forget about him cheating us. He's letting us look after his share. - What? - Are you with us? We're leaving tomorrow morning. Johan, wake up. St\\u00e5hlgren says the Coast Guard received a signal... on the emergency frequency. It sounded like a brawl. From Nordlands\\u00f6n, one hour by boat from Lundby tunnel. The others have gone home. Should we add more to the bow? Should we put some under the tarpaulin? - Elomaa? - I don't know. Good morning. Two million. How is Svensson? And warrior Elomaa? I'm not sure. Maybe his pride is wounded, but physically he's fine. - Are we ready? - I forgot a couple of keys. - Hello, my friend. - Hello. Wait. - Where are you letting me off? - We could sail around the island. But it's best to take a healthy walk through the woods. There's a fishing camp three miles that way. Roe and shrimp. Take a water taxi from there. Or join us in the sun on the beaches. - Helicopter. - Take cover! - Coast Guard or police? - Does it matter? They're circling overhead. Clearly, they're looking for something. I wondered when the first helicopter would show up. Do you know what gave you away? You know what I mean. The key chain. You returned with the keys in your hand to show that you had them. He's dead, right? I would have done the same thing, Seth. You can take it easy. I won't say anything. I sat with Svensson last night. He raved the whole time and said your name several times. Seth. Seth Rydell. Take it easy. I can be relied upon. A helicopter, there! They're coming straight towards us. Damn. Damn... Are you going to play Archipelago Rambo? I saved your life in Sheberghan. - Don't give me orders, you fucking cunt. - Shoot the helicopter! Then they'll back off. - Hell! - Down! Hell! What are we going to do? Tell us! Take it easy. Here we go. Hang with me! - Better if we split up. - Pity. We would be a good battle team. What the hell do we do? - Police! - Show your hands! - Mamma's going to be pissed off. - Do me a favor. - Close your eyes. - You know how it's going to be. She's... No! Seth! Over here! - 98 from 01. Understood. Thanks. - One dead upstairs. The helicopter saw someone with two bags and a rifle moving that way... about three kilometers. Off you go. Niklas! Take over there. Vidar, go get 'em. - Any regrets? - Yes. I have. - Do you have a weapon for me too? - AK or pistol? I'll take the pistol. Go! Clear! Hell... Clear! - No. - Patrick, there were five. Including the Riksbank driver. You can't tell who they are from the video. We don't know if we got them all. But we'll find out. Where the hell have you been? I met a girl in a bar. Did she drive a truck or a van? You should call Natascha. She did not sound happy that you just ran off. She talked about moving to her mother's in Sk\\u00e5ne. And the phone's been ringing like crazy in your jacket. - See you. - Bye. 17 Missed Messages - Did you think I had changed sides? - Not at all. I trusted you. But, hey... We found 240 million on the boat. Eight million with the dead, Elomaa. Do you know where the last two million went? No, sorry. No idea. I'm as sure of my innocence, as you were that I didn't change sides. - Where's the CPU? - 2.5 metres inside the door, Sophie said. The Riksbank driver said Elomaa shot his partner. Yes. What else has he told you? Take it easy. He hasn't mentioned you. Everyone else is dead. Svensson died of a gunshot wound in the stomach. Lundstr\\u00f6m, suicide by cop. Elomaa... shot himself in the head in a boathouse. That's too bad. And Riksbank doesn't pay a reward... without the name and details of the recipient. It's necessary for tax purposes, they say. Even if the police were in favour of it, Riksbank won't do it. What can I say? Hooray for Swedish bureaucracy! Sorry. Great, Matte! Finally, you've learned how to disable an alarm effectively. - I thought you'd use some high-tech stuff. - I already did... a signal jammer aimed right through the wall. Didn't you see it? You wanted the burglary to look like the work of a junkie. Right. Take a few bottles when you go. He may have some raki. If we find what we're looking for, will we turn it in as lost property? Once again, traditional police work has paid off. Police aviation surveillance was responsible for the arrests Check this out. An old classic. Imagine that! He put it in the washing machine. Don't think we can relax now and rest on our laurels. The fight against serious, organized crime continues. Wait here. What are you doing? He has opened the gates of heaven... so that I may enter in. Through his blood he has saved me... and kept me as his own.

Yeah, the Duke would take one to the shoulder in all his movies, then he'd just shake it off like it was a mosquito bite. Well, this one's more like a spaghetti Western. Involving Italians. Lots of blood. BRASS By the way, the guy they wheeled out of here, that's Hank Rinaldi. He and his mother run the place. A lot of cops like to hang out here. SANDERS Camera's up there. We'll get tape. And this must be where Hank went down? BRASS That's where we found him, curled around his Glock. cell phone rings Guessing this is Mom? BRASS Yeah, that's Dolores Rinaldi. One tough mother. Go ahead. SANDERS Multiple gunshot wounds. .45 still gripped. camera clicking She went down fighting. Shooting at him, I'm assuming. Three gunshot wounds to the torso, one to the head. Edward Smith, 40. Local address. He's got a fat wad of hundreds in here. Must be at least five grand. cash register beeps Drawer's stocked with cash. There's lots of antiques here. Lugers, Tokarevs, old Colts. Some good stuff here. Doesn't look like robbery.

VARTANN Hey. Catherine. Thanks. Welcome. Body's over here. A couple of teenagers were cutting through the park and spotted her. Thought she was sleeping. Snug as a bug in a rug. There's a path of displaced gravel coming down the embankment. High-speed body dump? SIDLE Well, if it is, then this quilt is awfully clean. WILLOWS So, how'd it get here? Covered up after the fact? There's road rash under the blanket. tires squeal heavy thud VARTANN iSuspect made no attempti ito hide her.i WILLOWS iYet he made an efforti ito tuck her in.i It's oddly tender, huh? For a body dump. Act of remorse? Maybe our killer has a conscience. I was in the back room. I heard them arguing, Ma and this guy. It's the guy in the baseball cap, right? No, no. Not him. The other one. The one in the red shirt. muffled arguing cocks gun iI didn't get a good look at him.i I just started shooting. No! iHad to defend my mother.i iNot that she's ever been a sissy.i iAnd this customer,i ihe starts unloading at the crazy guy, too.i So, this guy in a red shirt, he takes out you, your mother and a customer? One against three? Sir, there were a lot of bullets flying. I don't know who hit who. âª Told me you didn't love me no more âª âª Yes, I heard of that one before âª âª Same thing, same news âª âª Treat me like a fool that you can use âª âª Let me tell you, I won't be kind âª âª You can put it right there where the sun don't shine âª âª I ain't lying âª âª Where the sun don't shine âª âª You can take this, uh, put it away âª âª You can use it another day âª âª Just remember, keep this in mind âª âª You can put it right there where the sun don't shine. âª SANDERS Okay, here go the lights. The red lasers are customer Ed's shots. gunshot These are Dolores's shots. gunshot And these are Hank's shots. gunshot And according to Hank, the man in the red shirt was everyone's target. Which is consistent with everyone's trajectories, assuming he was a moving target. But where are Red Shirt's bullets? Well, all of these shots are misses. Maybe he fired and didn't miss. cell phone ringing Langston's out of autopsy. Ed's ammo killed Dolores. A combination of Dolores' and Hank's ammo killed Ed. And the surgeon pulled one of Ed's nine mils out of Hank's shoulder. Well, that answers that question. The man in the red shirt never fired. So, all three shooters missed him and only hit each other? Warrick and I worked a case once where two guys were shooting at each other in an elevator. Zero out of 25 were hits. Yeah, but the math is off. Customer Ed put four of his nine mils into Dolores, one into Hank and ten into the back wall here. That's 15 shots. And we collected 16 nine mil cases. So, we're missing a bullet. All of Ed's shots missed in this direction. And unless it's in Red Shirt, it's got to be in this back wall. Got it. Straight through the wall and into the stockroom. Huh. Ed's nine mil. STOKES All projectiles now accounted for, which means Red Shirt wasn't hit. That's hard to believe. rattling Doesn't sound like gun oil. This can top's been doctored. At least ten grand here. It's probably the Rinaldis' 401AK. Full-auto sears. SANDERS iInsert thesei iinto the lower receiveri iof a semiauto rifle,i iand you've got yourself a fully automatic machine gun.i Which is why they're illegal, and fetch a mint on the black market. Two excellent reasons for hiding them. ROBBINS iRan her prints.i Still a Jane Doe. Suffered multiple traumatic events before she died. C.O.D. is no surprise. Disarticulation of the atlanto-occipital junction... Consistent with her impact into the rock. This, however, is the result of a separate incident. Superficial bullet wound. She was shot? Sodium rhodizonate test was positive for lead. The extent of the blood clotting indicates it was antemortem... Shot at least an hour prior to death. So, he shoots her, but doesn't kill her, then dumps her out of a car an hour later, which does kill her. Why didn't he just shoot her again? Well, I saw the crime scene photos. It's only luck of the draw that she hit that rock. Not much logic to it. Gun shop's camera was out of focus, only took intermittent still shots and was on an oscillating pattern. It's hard to choreograph a less useful record of events. However, there were two helpful frames before the camera was knocked out by a stray shot. This one shows Ed Smith and Red Shirt walking into the store together. LANGSTON You can't see Red Shirt's face. But it does look like they're together. All right, now check this out. Hank blasting away at Ed. Red Shirt is in front of Mom. Not even in Hank's line of fire. STOKES He told Brass he was shooting at Red Shirt. Red Shirt is clearly not Hank's target. Which isn't the only thing Hank lied about. He told Brass that Ed was just a random, well-armed customer. Ed was another customer, all right. His prints were all over the cash with the full-auto sears. Which explains the five grand we found in his wallet. He was there to purchase more sears. From Hank. Whose prints were on both the cash and the sears. So, Hank's about to make another big sale. Why shoot such a good customer? Get too greedy for the green stuff, you can get yourself hurt. We know about your little side business there, Hank, selling the full-auto sears. Which is a federal offense in itself. You pile on the fact that you lied to the cops about killing Ed Smith... He was robbing us. I was... I was afraid if I told you, you'd take a closer look at him, find out about the sears. Honest, I was just defending our store. Mom arguing HANK iI come out of the back,i iand Ed's got my ma at gunpoint.i iAnd not just him... he brought some partner with him.i iSo I did what my mother taught me.i Hey! fires gun Guy kills your mom, you're okay saying he died trying to defend her? You make him out to be a hero. The truth wasn't going to bring her back. And I didn't want to go to jail. sighs So, you caught him, right? Ed's wingman, the guy in the red shirt. You caught him, right? That's how you learned all this? Well, actually... But we're getting close. Oh, God. STOKES What? He's still out there? You got to find him. That guy, the way he was just standing there with those bullets flying all around? He was not human. shots firing He was like the Terminator. A machine. iI've seen my share of crazies.i iBut this guy...i iWasn't his first time at the death dance.i iAs long as he's out there, I'm staying right here.i camera clicks camera clicks camera clicks Hey. Car was parked in a loading zone off Industrial. The ticketing officer saw the blood and towed it in. I'm hoping it's related to our body dump. RO is a Carrie Warren of Noelle Lane, Las Vegas. WILLOWS Is that an I.D. badge? It's our Jane Doe from the ditch. She was dumped from her own car. Clearly, she wasn't driving. So, uh... what's going on with you and Vartann? I am a trained observer, you know. chuckles Okay. I see it's still in its, uh, early investigative stages. No comment. Huh. Same pattern as the quilt she was wrapped in. Key's still in the ignition. key turns, chime sounds Out of gas. Explains why the killer left the murder mobile in plain sight. removes key from ignition Looks like we have her house keys. LVPD! Anybody home? WILLOWS How's it look? No sign of forced entry. All Carrie Warren. Looks like she lived alone. SIDLE I got a blood trail. It's all clear. You're not going to like what you find in the bedroom. I'm going to check the perimeter. Blood spatter on the wall. This is where she was shot. camera clicks, whirrs SIDLE Sheets match the quilt she was wrapped in. There's no photos of any humans, but she sure had some love for this German shepherd. WILLOWS Yeah. Roscoe. Oh, my God. It's Roscoe. sighs He was shot. Blood trail ends in the garage. WILLOWS So... killer's in the bedroom. dog barking iShoots the dog.i Carrie screaming iShoots Carrie.i iTakes Carrie and the quilt,i and takes her car. Control, this is 802 Charlie, Detective Vartann. I need Animal Control to transport a dead dog. Carrie's tidy. Strange that she'd leave food trash in the bedroom. Maybe the killer likes milk. Stain on the bed skirt. Milky vomit. I'll get it to DNA. Maybe we'll get lucky on some epithelials. There's no pictures of any boyfriends, yet she's got a drawer full of... tokens of someone's affections. Mm. She doesn't want to look at them anymore, but she can't bring herself to throw them away. Maybe Roscoe wasn't the only man in her life. PHILLIPS iBacked over by a car.i Fell down a well. Attacked by coyotes. Poisoned by a spider. Lost in a cave. Traded for a Mike Schmidt rookie baseball card. And my favorite, given to a farm. Allegedly. The tragic fates of the Phillips family dogs. Oh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Oh, sorry. I-I extracted a bullet from his, uh, dorsal lumbar. Shallow penetration. Uh, lack of vital response in the surrounding tissue indicates he was shot postmortem. Oh, accounts for the lack of blood at the scene. No blood pressure, no bleeding. C.O.D.? Undetermined at this point. Huh. Medium caliber bullet flattened on two sides. Double ricochet explains the shallow penetration. iAnd the fact that we have two wounds,i ibut just one bullet.i I bought my first Ruger 1022 from Rinaldi's. Oh, sweet. Colt single-action Army. Beautiful. Oh, this baby's a shooter, not a collector. Dang it. Hey, guys. I know you're slammed. This is the round that we pulled from our female victim's German shepherd. You're looking for the Truth About Gats and Dogs? both chuckle Little bit of ballistics humor there for you. See, 7.62 by 25 mil. Only a few rare old makes of gun use this ammo. Mauser, Tokarev, Norinco... Hold on. We collected a Tokarev from the gun shop. Here it is. casing clatters Whoa. Whoa. The case was stuck in the chamber. You were supposed to clear that at the scene, Greg. I know, but I got it out of a shattered merchandise case. Guns for sale are supposed to be unloaded by law. It's clear. And, y'all, there's a piece of somebody in here. Must've blocked the slide with their hand. Now, there is no way Rinaldi's would sell a gun with an expended case in the chamber and a hunk of skin in the slide. Maybe it wasn't for sale. Wait a sec. If your vic was shot with that gun earlier today, and it wasn't for sale at Rinaldi's, then it stands to reason that your killer brought it there. There were four players in the shootout, and only three known guns. Maybe the Tokarev belongs to the man in the red shirt. Who's the man in the red shirt? Some guy on a crime spree. Bobby, can you run the serial number? Then we need to compare my bullet with your gun. typing RO is a John Rakow. Guy lives... Right behind Carrie Warren. Mr. Rakow, I see from your file you served in the military. And you have a Tokarev automatic registered to you. Yeah. I brought that back from 'Nam. That gun saved my ass more than once. Thank you for your service, Mr. Rakow. You're welcome. Where is the Tokarev now? I gave it to a friend. What's the friend's name? It's a neighbor. Why? Carrie Warren? Yeah. SIDLE You guys get along? Well, I ain't particularly crazy about that yappy mutt of hers, but we worked that out. Mr. Rakow, do you make it a point to arm your entire neighborhood, or just the pretty girls? I had a daughter once. She was about the age of Carrie. She moved to New York. Young girl all alone in a big city. I wish somebody had looked out after her. So, I look out after Carrie I protect her. Protect her from what? This armpit of a city. You know, when seconds count, you... you cops are minutes away. So, you got a crazy-ass boyfriend, got some screws loose. She's always breaking up with him, and he's always begging to come back. So, how do you fit into all this? I chased him off a couple times, but I couldn't watch her for 24-7, so I gave her the Tokarev and taught her how to use it. Something happen to Carrie? She's dead. Someone shot her and her yappy mutt with your gun. I'm done talking. BRASS Okay, let's talk about something else, then. What about the boyfriend? Has he got a name? Dirtbag. And I can't recall his last name. The man is wearing boots as big as all of Texas. iThere's no way he could cram those dogsi iinto size-nine sneakers.i Plus, I observed his hands there's no slide bite. He didn't shoot Carrie. He wasn't in the gun shop. He's not the man in the red shirt. ANDREWS iI got Roscoe's tox panel.i Your German shepherd was poisoned. High concentrations of lorazepam and diazepam in his blood. Found the same anti-anxiety drugs in the milk you collected from the bedroom. So, based on his stomach contents, Carrie's dog drank the poison milk. What about Carrie's tox? She was clean. Stomach was empty. No milk. We didn't find any prescriptions at Carrie's house. Red Shirt had to have brought the drugs with him. So, he dissolves them in milk and feeds them to the dog? The dog apparently regurgitated some of the mixture onto the bed skirt, but not enough to save his life. Killer premeditates the dog's murder, but not Carrie's? Well, not necessarily. He poisons the dog to shut it up, waits for her to come home, then shoots her with her own gun. Well, if that's true, he knew her. He knew her dog. He knew where she kept the gun. No signs of forced entry. He had to have a key. Obvious question... She have a boyfriend? Oh, yeah. And I'm betting he has a red shirt. I mean, is this what women really want? chuckles It's what men think women want. Like candy. It's sweet and hard to resist, but sooner or later, we just want some meat and potatoes. gravelly voice All the women I take out just order a salad. laughs God, I used to have drawers full of this crap from guys. Now I just want a man I can count on. My eternal love is yours in life and in death. Forever, Sam. That sure sounds like a boyfriend. Although I never wrote a love poem to a girl that included the word death. There's something under that label. Sam gift-lifted this book from the public library and gave it to his beloved. Classy. Call the library and find out who the last borrower was. âª âª knocking Las Vegas Police. Anybody home? football game playing on TV Go, go, go, go, go. Hup. Who are you? I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police. We're looking for Sam Trent. Who are you? I'm Paul Trent, his father. He's not home. What happened here, Mr. Trent? It was an accident. BRASS Any idea where Sam is? PAUL My son's 27. I-I don't interfere with his personal life. Well, we do. We have a warrant to search your house. What's this about? An overdue library book. Mr. Trent, I need you to come with me. Another accident. Mm-hmm. SIDLE Styron, Plath, Sexton... Looks like a reading list for Morbid 101. Taste in cinema appears to be much lighter. These are all romantic comedies. SIDLE With the kind of guy who never gives up until he wins the heart of his dream girl? Of course, Sam's dream girl is dead. A photograph of Sam and Carrie. Proves they were together. Mm-hmm. Does this look like it was taken from the top of the Stratosphere to you? No, it's not high enough. It's got to be the Ivory Tower Skydeck. It's kind of a dumpy old tourist trap with a nice view of the methadone clinic across the street. I'll take you there sometime. Gee, thanks. I have... at least a dozen ticket stubs to the Skydeck. Maybe it was, uh, Sam and Carrie's favorite place. Eight bucks a pop. What do you have? Letters. Sam, meeting you up there, the city sprawling below us, changed my life. This is five days later. Sam, I'm sorry, but I can't be with you anymore. And then, a few days after that I can't stop thinking about you. I need you. You're the best thing that ever happened to me. Sam, I hope we can always be friends. Light-switch romance. On and off. Well, this is from last week. You need to respect my boundaries, Sam. It's over. Leave me alone, or my neighbor will kick your ass. Good neighbor John Rakow? Diazepam. Lorazepam. Both scripts written last week. Both empty. That's what killed Carrie's dog. Mmm. Some other... letters here. This one... written two days ago. From Sam to Carrie. Looks like a early draft. Carrie, we have talked about this. I know talking is easier than going through with it. But after the darkness comes the light. In a painless moment, we can be together... forever. That sounds like an invitation to a suicide pact. She's dead. Did he change his mind? You have the results from the Carrie Warren scene? I do. Uh... there was DNA on the lip of the tainted milk bottle, and I just matched it to Sam Trent's toothbrush that was sent over from his house. Sam drank the poisoned milk? Yeah. Which is why I then ran the vomit, and it turns out it wasn't actually the dog's. The mucosal cells were a match to Sam. Sam tried to commit suicide in Carrie's bedroom, but failed? Mm-hmm. sighs What about the tissue from the gun? machine beeps Just came up. It's Carrie Warren. You're joking. She shot herself? WILLOWS The physical evidence now supports the suicide pact theory. SANDERS Only Sam didn't die from the poison, and Carrie didn't die from the gunshot. STOKES Okay, check this out. This is Carrie's house. This is where we found the body. This is where you found her car. And this is Rinaldi's Gun Ammo. I think that Sam took the gun and Carrie, got in her car, and I think he was headed for the gun shop. The gun was jammed. It wasn't his gun, so maybe he thought it ran out of ammo. Needed more bullets, so he could finish them both off. Okay, so why did he dump her on the side of the road on the way to the gun shop? Well, Carrie was dumped at the apex of a hairpin turn. And a piece of the quilt was in the passenger door latch, which could have prevented the door from fully closing. tires screeching I mean, an accident would explain why he wrapped her in a quilt. Nothing was going according to plan. She's dead he's not. He's probably feeling left behind. Yeah, and now he really needs to get to that gun shop, so when the car runs out of gas, he just walks the rest of the way. Suicidal guy enters a gun shop, desperate for another bullet to pop into his Tokarev. If they're not going to give one to him, maybe they'll shoot one at him. Mmm. So, somehow, Sam triggered the gunfight. And just his luck, he's the only one that walks out of there unscathed. door rattling Sara... the closet door's been kicked in. I don't think Sam did this. Does that look like a cowboy boot to you? Texas-sized. Mr. Trent, if you want to try to help us save your son's life, you've got to tell me what happened in your house. There was a knock at the door. Barely heard it over the TV. When I went to answer it... football game playing on TV door banging glass shattering Sam Trent... where is he? Where is he? Sam, you son of a bitch! When he didn't find Sam, he trashed the place and stormed out. Couple of minutes later, Sammy came home. Sammy... Sammy, what happened? Are you in trouble? There was a man here. I... I almost called the police. No police, Dad. Everything's going to be fine. Take my car. The guy had a gun. Go on, t-take my keys, grab-grab my wallet. Take what you need. Thanks, Dad. Sam only wanted eight dollars from his father? The price of an Ivory Tower Skydeck ticket. Hey, you-you can't park here. I just received Carrie Warren's medical records. She had a history of bipolar disorder for which she recently was being treated at St. Anthony's Hospital, 101 Southwest Harmony Avenue. 101 SW. The shopping list from the gun shop. Yeah. It was an address. Uh-huh. We just assumed that he was driving Carrie to the gun shop. This is her house... body, car... There's the gun shop. And just to the west of it... St. Anthony's. He was headed for the hospital. Sam was trying to save her life. wind whistling vehicles passing below distant car alarm blaring sirens wailing siren whoops Control, officers are moving into position cell phone rings at the Ivory Tower. I need a full rescue team response. Detective Vartann and a police officer are already up there. You're free to go up. I don't want any heroes up there. Can you hear me, Catherine? You son of a bitch! You're a dead man, Sam Trent! Sam grunts One would think. gun cocks Police! Drop the weapon! Drop it! John, Sam didn't shoot Carrie. You're lying. We found her skin in the Tokarev slide. John, you know what that means? I know you do. Carrie shot herself. No, you're lying. She wouldn't do that. John, Carrie was bipolar. She'd attempted suicide before. SIDLE You told me that Carrie needed protection, but it wasn't from Sam. It was from herself. That's not true, John. I killed her. You shut up! I put the gun to her head. I brushed away... LANGSTON Sam, stop. I brushed away her hair, I looked into her eyes... and I-I just... LANGSTON John, after Carrie shot herself, Sam took her to the hospital. No, that's not true! I killed her, John. LANGSTON We found a note with the address to St. Anthony's on it. SIDLE Sam, you loved Carrie. You tried to save her. uncocks gun Sam! You don't have to die today! This is meant to be. You don't have to die today.

This is where Carrie and I met. And this is where it's destined to end. It doesn't have to end here. We know about the pact. We know you tried to save her. SIDLE And Carrie...

I mean... it wasn't technically a pact. iI wanted her to come home and find me.i Roscoe whimpering iMy whole being rendered solemn valentine.i Roscoe whimpering gunshot iThere was milk all over its snout.i iCarrie loved that dog.i iAnd when she came home and found him,i was it the sight of me or the dog that made her pull the trigger?
